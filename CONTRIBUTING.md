# Welcome to VF Protocol's Contribution Guide

Thanks for investing your time in contributing to VF Protocol! 

We're working to give the internet the native money layer it deserves and we can use every hand that is offered.

Check back soon for a full Code of Conduct and detailed guide for the contribution workflow. These are the barebones processes for now. Also, if you think you have a better way to do things - let me know! I'll update these accordingly.


## Issues
### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

### Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes
Make changes in the UI
Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.


## Code Improvements
Our V0 product is...fine. It will be awesome soon. I am putting together a To Do List to help contributors find parts to support with. To help us make it as awesome as it can be, please follow this process.

### Step 1 - Fork the repository.
Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

### Step 2 - Make changes locally
Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Step 3 - Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them. 

### Step 4 - Create Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.

Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.

Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Step 5 - Your PR is merged!
Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The VF Protocol team thanks you âœ¨.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the master branch.



Now that you are part of the VF Protocol community, we'll keep you in the loop on our progress! Sign up with the [VF Protocol](https://vfprotocol.substack.com/) email list for updates and posts.
